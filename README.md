# superPeer HTTP
A persistent, SEA-enabled, gundb node server combo for deployment to heroku or docker.

It will start two instances of gun one to handle http and one to handle https. They will sync and https instance will write to file.

Currently this needs to be modified to work in Docker or Heroku. (Needs Storage Container hookup)

Source for Docker Hub Container.

Kudos to @tensorTom to get this figured out.
